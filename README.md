# geoserver_data_dir
mostly empty geoserver data directory

has a workspace (ott) and styles that work in conjunction with the generated layers from https://github.com/OpenTransitTools/map_server

NOTE about git branches: these branches have added layers (generated by map_server) for specific RTP agencies in the Portland area. These branches are not to be merged into the 'clean' main branch, as that provides a minimal starting-point data_dir.
